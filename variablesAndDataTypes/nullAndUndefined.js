// Null and Undefined //

// Null is a data type availabe to you, the programmer
// Undefined is reserved for js itself to indicate something hasn't been given a value yet. 

let currentTemp; // undefined

const TARGET_TEMP = null; // null

currentTemp = 19.5; // 19.5

currentTemp = undefined; // undefined // dont do this!

// now currentTemp appears as if it had never been initalized; dont do this
